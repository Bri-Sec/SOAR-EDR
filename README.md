# SOAR & EDR

 *Currently in Progress*

## Objective

The SOAR & EDR project focused on building an automated incident detection and response workflow using Tines as the SOAR platform and LimaCharlie as the EDR solution. The goal was to simulate a real-world threat scenario—specifically, detecting the use of a password recovery tool on an endpoint—and automate the response process through playbooks (called stories in Tines). This included designing workflows that integrate Slack and email notifications, as well as conditional machine isolation based on user input. The project emphasized the importance of logic-based automation, tool-agnostic principles, and practical incident handling experience.

### Skills Learned

- Implementing end-to-end detection and response using LimaCharlie EDR and Tines SOAR.
- Designing and building automated playbooks (stories) that respond dynamically to security events.
- Integrating third-party services (e.g., Slack, email) into incident response workflows.
- Writing custom detection rules and forwarding security alerts to automation tools.
- Using logic and diagramming tools to plan and iterate SOAR workflows.
- Troubleshooting and refining automated response actions based on user feedback.
- Gaining a tool-agnostic understanding of SOAR principles, emphasizing concept over vendor.
- Building a project worthy of inclusion in a cybersecurity portfolio or resume.
